# Keyboard
This on-screen-keyboard mirrors the keys that the user presses on their physical keyboard. I made this after being inspired by [u/zhengc](https://www.reddit.com/user/zhengc)'s keyboard made with Adobe Illustrator. The original post can be viewed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/79ir7h/made_this_in_illustrator_today_thought_you_guys/). See a live demo of the project [here](matthewnau.github.io/keyboard).

## Customization

This keyboard can be customized very easily. To change the color of the main keys, simply edit the `.key` class in `main.css`. The `background-color` and `box-shadow` properties compose the colors associated with each key. To change the color of the blue and red keys, simply modify the same properties for the `.color2` and `.color3` classes.
